  With the near ubiquitous socio-economic changes as of late, a lot of people are using whatever extra time they have on their hands to tackle a small home project they've been meaning to get to, try creative activities with their loved ones, learn a new skill, expand an existing one, etc. I've been cooking a lot and I'm really enjoying myself by learning new recipies, do's and dont's, trying new ingredients, and buying the right tools. Once I get a new dish down perfectly, I've noticed I'm able to enter a zen-like state as I prep and cook a meal that can take hours of well-organized work as I try to get every step right. Then, finally, the result is so satisfying to enjoy for myself and (at least hopefully) my friends.
